          <p class="mb-5">
            The history of sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi])
            began with paddy fields, where fish was fermented with vinegar, salt
            and rice, after which the rice was discarded. The earliest form of
            the dish, today referred to as narezushi, was created in Japan
            around the Yayoi period (early Neolithic–early Iron Age). In the
            Muromachi period (1336–1573), people began to eat the rice as well
            as the fish. During the Edo period (1603–1867), vinegar rather than
            fermented rice began to be used. The dish has become a form of food
            strongly associated with Japanese culture. The inventor of modern
            sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, a
            type of sushi most known today, in which seafood is placed on
            hand-pressed vinegared rice, around 1824 in the Edo period. It was
            the fast food of the chōnin class in the Edo period.

        <h2 class="mt-5">Types of sushi and types of fish!</h2>
        <p class="mt-5">
          There are many varieties, but here are a few main types of sushi:
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Nigiri:</strong> Nigiri is a slice of fish placed over a small
          bit of rice.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Sashimi:</strong> Sashimi is slices of fish served without
          rice.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Maki:</strong> These bite-sized rolls have seaweed on the
          outside and rice (and other ingredients) on the inside.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Chirashi:</strong> When you think of chirashi, think
          deconstructed maki. Translating to "scattered" in Japanese, chirashi
          is a seasoned bowl of rice topped with slices of fish and other
          toppings like roe (fish eggs) and vegetables.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Hako:</strong> Hako sushi is also referred to as "pressed
          sushi." Ingredients are placed into a box and pressed to form a
          rectangular shape.
          <br />
          <br />

          There are also several types of fish used in sushi, but here are some
          of the ones you'll find on menus in the U.S.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Ahi:</strong> (yellowfin and bigeye tuna): Yellowfin tuna has
          a mild flavor and firm texture. Bigeye tuna has a buttery flavor due
          to its high fat content.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Hamachi:</strong> / kanpachi (yellowtail): Yellowtail is a
          leaner, milder, and slightly creamy tasting fish and the color is a
          very light pinkish-white.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Sake:</strong> (salmon): Salmon is easily recognized for its
          bright orange color and it ranges from lean to fattier pieces, with
          salmon belly coming at a premium price due to its extra fattiness.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Unagi and anago:</strong> (fresh and saltwater eel): Unagi has
          a rich flavor and anago is more mild.
