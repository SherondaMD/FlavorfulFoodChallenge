          <p class="mb-5">
            The history of sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi])
            began with paddy fields, where fish was fermented with vinegar, salt
            and rice, after which the rice was discarded. The earliest form of
            the dish, today referred to as narezushi, was created in Japan
            around the Yayoi period (early Neolithic–early Iron Age). In the
            Muromachi period (1336–1573), people began to eat the rice as well
            as the fish. During the Edo period (1603–1867), vinegar rather than
            fermented rice began to be used. The dish has become a form of food
            strongly associated with Japanese culture. The inventor of modern
            sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, a
            type of sushi most known today, in which seafood is placed on
            hand-pressed vinegared rice, around 1824 in the Edo period. It was
            the fast food of the chōnin class in the Edo period.

        <h2 class="mt-5">Types of sushi and types of fish!</h2>
        <p class="mt-5">
          There are many varieties, but these are the seven main types of sushi:
          Nigiri: Nigiri is a slice of fish placed over a small bit of rice.
          Sashimi: Sashimi is slices of fish served without rice. Maki: These
          bite-sized rolls have seaweed on the outside and rice (and other
          ingredients) on the inside. To taste maki, try out our spicy tuna roll
          or spicy crab roll. Uramaki: Uramaki is similar to maki, but the rice
          is on the outside, like in a shrimp tempura roll and Boston roll.
          Temaki: Temaki, also referred to as hand rolls, are cone-shaped and
          eaten by hand—no need for chopsticks here. Fillings, like rice,
          veggies, and fish, are wrapped up in a sheet of nori. Chirashi: When
          you think of chirashi, think deconstructed maki. Translating to
          "scattered" in Japanese, chirashi is a seasoned bowl of rice topped
          with slices of fish and other toppings like roe (fish eggs) and
          vegetables. Hako: Hako sushi is also referred to as "pressed sushi."
          Ingredients are placed into a box and pressed to form a rectangular
          shape.

          There are several types of fish used in sushi, but here are some of
          the ones you'll most commonly find on menus in the U.S., according to
          Kabaoglu. Ahi (yellowfin and bigeye tuna): Yellowfin tuna has a mild
          flavor and firm texture. Bigeye tuna has a buttery flavor due to its
          high fat content. Ebi (sweet shrimp, prawns): There are many varieties
          of shrimp and prawns used for sushi, according to Kabaoglu, such as
          amaebi and botan ebi (sweet shrimp), aka ebi (red shrimp), and kuruma
          ebi (Japanese tiger prawns). Hamachi / kanpachi (yellowtail):
          "Yellowtail is a leaner, milder, and slightly creamy tasting fish that
          comes into season during the early summer," he said. "The color is a
          very light pinkish-white that’s almost translucent." Ika (squid):
          "Squid becomes thin and flat when cut into pieces, so it’s usually
          julienned into thin slivers to make the presentation more attractive
          for sashimi." Maguro (bluefin tuna): "Maguro is one of the most highly
          prized fish around the world," he said. There are different cuts of
          maguro, such as akami (lean), chutoro (medium-fatty), and otoro
          (fatty). Sake (salmon): "Salmon is easily recognized for its bright
          orange color," said Kabaoglu. "It ranges from lean to fattier pieces,
          with salmon belly coming at a premium price due to its extra
          fattiness." Unagi and anago (fresh and saltwater eel): Unagi has a
          rich flavor and anago is more mild.
